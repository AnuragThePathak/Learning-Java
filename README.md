# Learning Java

It contains the codes I have written in while learning Java as well as some of Data Structures and Algorithms. I mainly followed [Kunal Kushwaha's Bootcamp](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ) to learn Java and DSA hence the topics included here is also similar to that playlist itself.
